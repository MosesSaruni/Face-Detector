OpenCV Facial detection

Facial recognition software using python’s OpenCV library. It uses the host device’s camera to capture a video feed. It then uses a haarCascade classifier on each frame to recognize human faces and consequently superimposes a colored square on the detected human face for every frame thus facilitating real-time facial detection.
